 <div class="article column1">
 <p>"I decided to try botox to help freshen up my face. I was recommended Kevin by a trusted friend who has been going to him for a number of years. From the moment I arrived in the waiting room I felt relaxed.
    His reception is new. I was very nervous and immediately put me at ease. The experience was a very positive one. Kevin made me feel secure and happy. And the procedure was quick and pain free. I was delighted with the results."</p>

 <div class="article column2">
 <p>"My family and I have been attending Winning Smiles Dental Practice for the last 6 years. Through out this time we always found the staff to be extremely polite, efficient and helpful. 
 Kevin has always been very professional in his approach to us yet friendly and reassuring, especially towards our younger children who enjoy going for their check-ups! I would highly recommend this practice to anyone."</p>
 <p> - Jennifer, Cork </p>

 <div class="article column3">
 <p>"I attended Winning Smiles dental surgery as an emergency during Covid 19 as my orthodontist was closed. Two of my braces came off my teeth. I contacted Winning Smiles and they were very accommodating, even though I am not a client of theirs I was seen the following day. 
 The dentist was great, he put my mind at ease and had the procedure completed in 30 minutes. I am very satisfied with the outcome."</p>
